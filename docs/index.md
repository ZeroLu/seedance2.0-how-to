## 🚀 How to Access Seedance 2.0

As of February 2026, there are three primary ways to access the model depending on your resources (Phone number, VPN location, etc.).

### Method 1: Official CN Route (Jimeng)
*   **Requirement:** +86 Phone Number, VPN (CN/Asia preferred), WeChat Pay (for credits).

**Steps:**
1.  Use VPN to relocate to China (HK or China mainland)
2.  Navigate to the [jimeng.jianying.com](https://jimeng.jianying.com/) or [xyq.jianying.com](https://xyq.jianying.com/).
3.  Login using a **Chinese mobile number** (+86).
4.  Choose `Seedance 2.0` or `Seedance 2.0 fast`. New accounts receive free trial credits to test Seedance 2.0.

6.  **Top-up:** If you run out of credits, you can purchase more using **WeChat Pay**.

### Method 2: The Doubao Workaround (Free / Limited)
*   **Limit:** ~10 credits/day (Approx. 5 videos). 2 credits per video.

**Steps:**
1.  Set your VPN location to **Hong Kong**.
2.  Create a clean/new Chrome Profile to ensure no cookie conflicts.
3.  Go to [doubao.com](https://www.doubao.com). Use Chrome's built-in translator to switch the page to English.

6.  Click on "AI Creation" on the left bar.

8.  In the chat/prompt box, you must explicitly tell the AI to generate a video. Use this format:
    ```text
    Generate a video not an image, [INSERT YOUR PROMPT HERE]
    ```
    *Example: "Generate a video not an image, a cyberpunk cat walking in the rain."*

### Method 3: The Global API Route (Cyberbara)
*Recommended after Feb 24, 2026. Best for Developers & International Users.*

**Details:**
1.  ByteDance is scheduled to release the official API around **Feb 24, 2026**.
2.  Cyberbara is one of the first official partners of ByteDance. And it will integrate Seedance 2.0 API immediately. Go to [cyberbara.com/seedance2.0](https://cyberbara.com/seedance2.0) and sign in to reserve a spot.
3.  This will likely be the most stable method for users outside of China to access Seedance 2.0 without phone number restrictions.

### Methods Not Working: BytePlus and Dreamnia

1. BytePlus removed Seedance 2.0 access.

2. Dreamnia has not opened Seedance 2.0 access yet

3. Beware of other scam websites claiming to have Seedance 2.0 API before Feb 24th. The offical API won't be released until Feb 24th!
