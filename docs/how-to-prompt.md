### 3.1. Giant Orange Cat Meme Style
*Comedic surrealism featuring a Godzilla-sized orange cat in a Chinese city.*

**Prompt:**
```
【Style】Mockumentary, mobile Vlog perspective, hyperrealistic CG combined with real scenes, 8K quality, perfect fur physics simulation.
【Duration】15 seconds
【Scene】Hongya Cave in Chongqing or a busy overpass intersection (with magical 8D city feel).
[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Visual spectacle (The Reveal).
The scene shows a bustling city street. The camera lifts up to reveal a **Gozilla-sized orange tabby cat** stuck between two skyscrapers.
Action: The giant cat is stuck because it's too fat, waving its huge paws with a pitiful expression, trying to pull itself out.
Detail: Cat fur is clearly visible in the sunlight, huge paw pads pressing against glass curtain walls, deforming the glass.
[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Absurd interaction (The Interaction).
The camera switches to ground-level perspective. Traffic flows on the street, traffic lights flashing. The giant cat lowers its head, bringing its huge cat face close to the ground, curiously sniffing a bus waiting at a red light.
Action: The bus driver calmly reaches out and pets the giant cat's nose. The cat sneezes, instantly blowing away roadside leaves and pedestrians' hats (wind effect).
[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Memetic ending (The Punchline).
The giant cat finally squeezes past the buildings and sits down on a cross-river bridge, causing the bridge deck to sink slightly (physical feedback).
Narrative sense: It lazily lies down and starts grooming itself, blocking the entire evening rush hour traffic. The camera finally freezes on its innocent big eyes.

## 4. UGC Style

This category focuses on "User-Generated Content" aesthetics, mimicking everyday camera phone footage with surreal twists.

### 4.1. Surrealistic Documentary Style
*Reality-bending vlog with a twist on mirror reflections.*

**Prompt:**
```
【Style】Mockumentary (Vlog Style), hyperrealism, fixed-camera real-shot feel, natural lighting, with a slight suspenseful comedy tone.
【Duration】15 seconds
【Main Character】An ordinary young beautiful woman, in front of the bathroom sink at home.
[00:00-00:06] Shot 1: Daily setup (Normalcy).
Scene: In front of a regular bathroom mirror.
Action: The protagonist is brushing her teeth, mouth full of foam. She makes various funny faces (squinting, eyebrow-wiggling) at the mirror while brushing her teeth.
Key detail: At this point, the reflection in the mirror is completely normal, movements synchronized.
[00:06-00:11] Shot 2: BUG appears (The Glitch).
Action: After brushing teeth, the protagonist lowers her head to spit out foam, then turns around to leave the bathroom.
High-impact moment (core climax): Just as the protagonist's real body has turned and left the mirror frame, the "reflection" in the mirror **doesn't move**! That "reflection" still maintains the tooth-brushing pose, even mischievously raising eyebrows at the camera with a bad smile, staying for a full 2 seconds, before suddenly panicking and "fast-forwarding" to catch up with the original body's movements before disappearing.
Director's note: Must create an extremely realistic "network delay" feel, as if the reflection has independent consciousness.
[00:11-00:15] Shot 3: Comedic callback (The Punchline).
Action: The protagonist, who has already walked to the door, seems to sense something is wrong, suddenly turning back to look at the mirror.
Result: The mirror has now completely returned to normal, completely empty, only reflecting the opposite wall. The protagonist scratches her head in confusion, showing a life-questioning expression toward the camera. The frame freezes on the protagonist's confused face (comedy effect).

*Testing dynamic consistency and motion transitions with high-frequency, large-scale actions.*

Visual: Close-up. Nezha's Red Armillary Sash gently sways in the wind with sparks flying. The camera suddenly zooms out rapidly.
Action: Nezha suddenly kicks off the ground, causing the earth to shatter.
Visual Focus: Testing Seedance 2.0's simulation of debris trajectory, and the transition from stillness to ultra-high-speed movement.

Act 2: Attribute Transition (Testing Match Cut Editing)

Transition Design: The flame ring seamlessly transforms into Ao Bing's rotating ice blade while spinning.
Action: The camera follows the rotation axis of the weapons, achieving an instant, smooth transition from red tones to blue tones.

Act 3: Fierce Battle Interaction (Testing Physics Collision and Cinematography)
Visual: Mid-shot from the side. The Fire-Tipped Spear and ice sword collide in mid-air.
Action: Sparks and ice fragments explode simultaneously. Ao Bing's body moves like a dragon, spiraling upward around a fire pillar; Nezha inverts in the air, feet-first toward the ground on his Wind-Fire Wheels.
Visual Focus: Testing whether the model's limbs break down during "high-speed dueling" of the two characters.

Act 4: Ultimate Transition (Testing Space Folding)
Visual: Nezha punches and shatters an ice wall.
Transition Design: The shattered ice crystals transform into dancing red leaves or fire feathers in the air. The camera passes through the ice fragments and instantly cuts to the next scene.
Visual Focus: Testing Seedance 2.0's logical continuity using particle continuity.

### 5.6. Tournament of Power with Famous Anime Characters
*Epic anime battle scene with multiple characters from different series in a cosmic arena.*

**Prompt:**
```
A massive cosmic arena forms in a blinding void, Tournament-of-Power scale. Crowds from countless universes roar.
At the center stands the narrator: Gintoki Sakata, relaxed, wooden sword on his shoulder, bored eyes, sharp tongue.
He announces the rules casually, almost mocking fate: "This tournament decides the strongest. Winner gets a harem." Beat. The crowd explodes. Gintoki sighs. "Yeah, yeah. Don't look at me like that. I didn't write the rules."
The camera glides to elevated platforms revealing the women of legend, all clearly unimpressed in different ways:
Bulma adjusts her device, already annoyed.
Android 18 crosses her arms, deadpan.
Hinata watches quietly, composed.
Sakura cracks her knuckles.
Nami smiles like she's already planning something.
Boa Hancock looks away, offended by existence itself.
Mikasa doesn't react. At all.
Erza stands like a judge.
Nico Robin smiles politely—dangerously.
Rukia tilts her head, curious.

Gintoki points. "First match. Try not to destroy the universe before lunch."
Two tunnels ignite.

From the left: Saitama walks out slowly, hands in pockets, face empty. He looks around. "Huh. This again."
From the right: Goku steps forward, serious, focused, sensing something deeply wrong. "You're strong… but you look like you don't care."
Close-ups alternate. Dust rises. Energy crackles.
Gintoki stands between them.
"Alright. Bald guy who's bored versus spiky guy who lives for this."
Lights drop.
Power surges.
Comedy and catastrophe collide.
```

"Sister don't be angry, this is called workplace involution. I'm thinking of quitting to sell 'Truth Serum' (healing balm)."

6–8 seconds:

【Scene】Above a clear city skyline, or an open wheat field.
[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Calm illusion (The Calm).
The scene shows a cloudless, absolutely beautiful blue sky, sunny and bright, with birds flying by. The camera slowly tilts upward, giving a feeling of peaceful times.
Key detail: Suddenly, a giant, silver metallic gleam appears in the sky—it's a **"zipper"** spanning across the horizon.
[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Unzipping the zipper (The Unzipping).
A **giant, translucent God's hand** grasps the zipper pull, slowly unzipping the blue sky with a tremendous roar (audio effect).
Action: As the zipper opens, the "blue sky" wrinkles and falls like fabric.
Visual spectacle: Behind the zipper is **not the universe**, but a **cyberpunk future world filled with neon lights, flying cars, and giant mechanical structures** (or a giant mechanical eye staring at us).
[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Gaze between two worlds (The Revelation).
Only a corner of blue sky remains hanging in the sky. It turns out our living world was just an "eco-box" covered up.
Ending: The camera rapidly pulls back to reveal that our entire world (city/wheat field) is actually just a **glass miniature landscape ball** on a giant's table. The giant is leaning in close to observe us.
